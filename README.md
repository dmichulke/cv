### Summary
I am an experienced programmer and entrepreneur with a strong background in Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.
I love solving difficult problems and most often develop Machine Learning applications from scratch up to production quality. This typically includes 

- fetching/cleaning/parsing/normalizing data,
- developing and training models
- generating output via REST APIs, report PDFs, ...
  
I mostly use [clojure](www.clojure.org) and [postgresql](www.postgresql.com) for these purposes but often enough I deviate (JS, Java, Python, cassandra, MongoDB, Oracle, ..).

Other than that I had a fair share of experience with accounting, cash flow dynamics, start-ups and sales so I also understand how and why a business fails or succeeds.
