### Summary

I am an experienced programmer and entrepreneur with a strong background in Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.
I love solving difficult problems, be it advising companies, developing Machine Learning applications or optimizing existing workflows.

I value simplicity, honesty and clarity in communication.

For development tasks I mostly use [clojure](www.clojure.org), [clojurescript](https://clojurescript.org/), often together with [react](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_\(JavaScript_library\)) and [postgresql](www.postgresql.com).
Some other technologies I frequently use are git, docker, JS, Java, Python, cassandra, MongoDB, Oracle, ...
